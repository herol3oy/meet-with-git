              - GitHub user 2: ${JSON.stringify(users[1])}
            The tone should be clever and comedic without relying on one user conceding or complimenting the other. Both users should hold their ground with sharp banter, drawing from their GitHub activity, coding styles, or favorite languages/tools. Include at least one gloriously smug, nose-in-the-air retort from either user to crank up the satire â€” but make sure it's matched with an equally clever comeback. Think of it like a battle of nerdy egos with mutual respect and zero groveling.`,
